# **Intelligent Query Processor**

## **Overview**

The Intelligent Query Processor (IQP) is a cutting-edge solution that leverages an agentic framework through Langraph to convert natural language requests into highly accurate database queries. Achieving a high success rate, the IQP goes beyond conventional query systems by implementing a custom search algorithm capable of returning complex, multi-hop relevant results. This revolutionary technology empowers users to extract deeply interconnected data with ease, making it an invaluable tool for anyone requiring advanced data retrieval capabilities.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Natural Language Understanding**
The IQP allows users to interact with databases using everyday language. Whether you're a seasoned developer or someone without technical expertise, you can request data in a way that feels natural and intuitive.

### **2. High Accuracy with Minimal Iterations**
The system boasts a 99% success rate in translating natural language into accurate database queries. This is achieved through a robust system environment feedback mechanism, where the Language Model (LLM) receives detailed feedback on any failures and can correct errors in minimal iterations. This feedback loop, coupled with meticulously engineered prompts, ensures that the model continually improves and adapts, resulting in an almost flawless performance.

### **3. Complex Multi-Hop Queries**
The custom search algorithm allows the IQP to handle complex queries that involve multiple data hops. For example, if a user asks, "Give me the notes associated with all of the ventures I'm working on and then also give me the notes of the ventures all of my friends are working on," the system can process this multi-layered request accurately and efficiently. This capability is a rare and highly valuable feature in the realm of generative AI, setting the IQP apart from other solutions.

### **4. Customizable and Extensible**
Built with flexibility in mind, the IQP can be tailored to fit a variety of databases and applications. Its modular architecture allows for easy integration with existing systems and the addition of new features as needed.

## **How It Works**

### **1. Natural Language to Query Conversion**
Using an agentic framework, the IQP translates natural language requests into precise database queries. This process involves sophisticated language models that understand context, intent, and the intricacies of the database schema.

### **2. Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement**
One of the core innovations of the IQP is its feedback mechanism. When the system encounters a failure or produces an incorrect result, it receives detailed, context-specific feedback that guides it toward a correction. This process is repeated until the query is successful, typically requiring only a few iterations due to the depth and precision of the feedback.

### **3. Multi-Hop Search Algorithm**
The IQP's custom search algorithm is designed to handle queries that require multiple data retrieval steps or "hops." This means it can not only fetch direct results but also navigate through related datasets to provide comprehensive answers to complex questions.

## **Why It Matters**

The ability to process complex natural language queries with such high accuracy and efficiency is a game-changer in the field of data retrieval. Traditional query systems are often limited in their ability to understand natural language, and even those that do can struggle with multi-hop queries or require extensive manual intervention to correct errors. The IQP solves these challenges, making advanced data retrieval accessible to everyone.

### **Applications**
- **Business Intelligence:** Empowering decision-makers with precise data extraction based on complex queries.
- **Research and Development:** Facilitating deeper insights by connecting disparate data points through multi-hop queries.
- **Customer Support:** Automating the retrieval of customer-related data based on natural language requests, improving response times and accuracy.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Python 3.x:** Ensure that Python is installed on your system.

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RPD123-byte/adalo_bot.git
   cd adalo_bot
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### **Running the Application**
Run the application using the following command:

```bash
python -m app.app
```

This will start the IQP system, allowing you to begin making natural language queries against your database.

### **Usage**
- Start by asking a natural language query, and watch as the IQP translates it into a database query and returns the results.
- Experiment with multi-hop queries to see the full power of the system in action.
